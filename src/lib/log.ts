 * It is NOT safe to persist as a cross-session cursor: the shard is a CRDT
 * Y.Text, so a merge with a concurrent writer can insert content *before* a
 * previously-recorded offset, which would make a naive tail-slice skip real
 * events. The store only trusts `start` when the new content still begins with
 * the exact prefix it last folded; otherwise it passes 0 and refolds whole.
